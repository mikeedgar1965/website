        <h1>NVIT Foundations Computer Basics course</h1>
        <h2> The struggle is real.</h2>
        <p>In the beginning there were no computers. Literly, the computers came in three days late. Our instructor Kerry Redman did her best to get us started by printing everything out so we could follow along. Which was great because other than listening to music or watching movies the computer really didn't appeal to me. Learning computer basics was very handy for me.</p>
