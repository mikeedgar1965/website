        <p> I'm Mike Edgar, what inspired this page is brain storming up an idea for my class project. Instead, I came up with so many ideas I couldn't decided which idea to do. I jokingly said, why not call it the head and a thought of the bathroom wall scribbled with a bunch of little bits of interesting information. </p>

        <h1>NVIT Foundations Computer Basics course</h1>
        <h2> The struggle is real.</h2>
        <p>In the beginning there were no computers. Literly, the computers came in three days late. Our instructor Kerry Redman did her best to get us started by printing everything out so we could follow along. Which was great because other than listening to music or watching movies the computer really didn't appeal to me. Learning computer basics was very handy for me.</p>
